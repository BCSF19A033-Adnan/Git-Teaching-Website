    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
        Git is an open source a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank">version control system</a>, developed by Linus Torvalds. Git is like an ultimate save button for your files/projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        A save in Git records differences in the files and folders AND keeps a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub or other alternatives such as: Bitbucket, Beanstalk, or GitLab for sharing and collaborating with other developers.

    <p>
        At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
